# docs/STATE.md — dated changelog

Newest first. One `### YYYY-MM-DD — <title>` block per change: **what changed and
why**. Append a block; never edit an existing line. Behaviour is specified in the
owning doc under [features/](features/), not here.

## Changelog

### 2026-08-08 — Onboarding/Connect + Settings actions wired — AIC-21/24
Onboarding now renders the real `onboarding_status` (→ card + stepper) and the
signed-in name; Connect shows the real connection state and "check connection"
calls `POST /api/app/connection/recheck` (live per-asset verify with a Meta
token, else the stored health). Settings gained three real actions: budget-change
request (`POST /api/app/budget-request` → ops item, `server/src/services/customer-actions.ts`),
check-connection (shared recheck), and change-password
(`POST /api/auth/change-password` — verifies the current password, then
`updatePassword`; new `findByIdWithHash`/`updatePassword` on the user store). The
header self-fetches the name once (`getMe`) so every screen shows it. Deferred to
tickets: the campaign-review screen (AIC-32, schema-vs-design mismatch) and the
real connect config — business-portfolio ID + WhatsApp/booking links (AIC-33).
Tests: `customer-actions.integration.test.ts`, change-password cases in
`auth-service.test.ts`.

### 2026-08-08 — Recommendation approve/dismiss wired over the pipeline — AIC-23
The customer recommendation surface is live: `GET /api/app/recommendations`
(+ `/:id`), `POST …/approve`, `POST …/dismiss` (`server/src/services/customer-recommendations.ts`),
all JWT-scoped to the caller's campaign. Approve transitions proposed → approved
and hands off to the AIC-12 `SafeExecutor` (no execution logic re-implemented);
outcomes map to plain-Hebrew customer messages, and a missing Meta token yields a
503 with the rec untouched. `Recommendations.tsx` list + detail render the
deterministic `explain()` text, exact current→proposed budget, and max spend
impact; the dev type-switcher is gone. `overview.pendingRecommendations` drives
the Home badge + nudge. The app header now fetches the signed-in name once
(`getMe`) so every screen shows it (loader, never the mock). New owning doc
`features/customer-recommendations.md`; lock-in test
`customer-recommendations.integration.test.ts`.

### 2026-08-08 — Home + Settings wired to live customer data — AIC-22/24
New JWT-scoped `GET /api/app/overview` (+ `POST /api/app/lead-quality`) assembles
the caller's account → customer → connection → campaign → subscription, the
snapshot-based readout, and condensed action history — reading only the caller's
own rows. `Home.tsx` and `Settings.tsx` now render from it (real KPIs, deltas,
budget, Meta connection, billing, activity); the Home dev state-switcher is gone
and the headline `homeState` is derived server-side. Honest empty states
(`collecting`, `—`, "nothing changed yet") instead of sample numbers. New owning
doc `features/customer-overview.md`. First real customer (sharon.mishayev@…, the
Pisga dogfood account) now loads end-to-end.

### 2026-08-08 — Customer auth backend wired (email+password + JWT) — AIC-21
Built the auth backend: `app_users` table (migration 011, case-insensitive unique
email), bcrypt passwords, our own JWT sessions (`JWT_SECRET`), `/api/auth/signup|
login|me` + `requireAuth`. Wired the frontend auth screens to the real endpoints
(store JWT, redirect), added `AuthGate` on signed-in routes + logout. Google
sign-in stays deferred (AIC-30); forgot/reset still frontend-only. Verified: 4 unit
+ 5 DB/HTTP integration tests; a real `app_users` row is created end-to-end. Owning
doc: `features/customer-auth.md`.

### 2026-08-08 — AIC-1 spike PASS (live) + admin API auth + Railway live
Live-verified the whole partner-access model on Pisga's real account: a read-only
probe + a no-op budget write routed through the full AIC-12 safe-execute pipeline
both PASSED under **Standard Access** — reads and writes on a partner-owned ad
account work without Advanced Access. AIC-1 Done; AIC-12/13 live-verified; AIC-25
descoped to a scale concern. Added `GraphCampaignAdapter` (real MetaReader/
ExecWriter) + gated probe/write-test tools. Closed the admin-API hole: `requireAdmin`
now **fails closed in production** when `ADMIN_TOKEN` is unset and requires a bearer
otherwise; web console gated via `AdminGate`. Also fixed two Railway deploy blockers
(NODE_ENV skipping devDeps → `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false`; cwd-relative web/dist →
`resolveWebDist`); the app is **live** at aicserver-production.up.railway.app serving
landing + SPA + API with Neon migrations applied.

### 2026-08-04 — Customer app screens (frontend, AdPilot design) — AIC-21/22/23/24
Built every customer-facing screen as frontend on mock data, from the AdPilot
Product Phase 1/2 design directions: auth (signup/login/forgot/reset), checkout,
onboarding (6 states + stepper), connect-Meta (4 outcomes), first-campaign review,
home dashboard (5 states + weekly lead-quality + activity), recommendations list +
detail (3 types × approve/dismiss/executed), settings & support. Added the AdPilot
design system (`web/src/ui.css`), shared components (`web/src/app/components.tsx`),
centralized copy (`strings.he.app`), and full routing (`App.tsx`). No backend yet —
screens navigate/switch via in-component state; wiring lands per ticket. Verified:
typecheck + build green; login/home/onboarding render faithfully. Owning doc:
`features/customer-app.md`. Open decision: the design's self-serve **checkout**
diverges from P0 manual billing — tracked separately.

### 2026-08-04 — Landing page (AdPilot design) — AIC-20
Replaced the placeholder `landing/index.html` with the full AdPilot marketing page
from the provided design directions: fluid responsive RTL Hebrew, brand palette
(orange/cream/ink/green/indigo) + Rubik/IBM Plex Mono, and all sections — hero
collage, dark ₪299-vs-₪1,200 comparison, how-it-works, dashboard mock, creative +
lead-quality + support, pricing, 8-question FAQ (native accordion), final CTA,
footer. CSS-only mockups (no external images). Verified: builds into
`web/dist/index.html`, renders at desktop + 375px with no horizontal overflow.
Contact CTAs + brand alignment (AdPilot vs AI Campaigner) flagged as open.

### 2026-08-03 — Ops console: manual billing + weekly lead-quality — AIC-19
Added the manual billing ledger (`updateBilling` + `conversionSummary` for
setup→subscription conversion, no payment gateway) and weekly campaign-level
lead-quality capture (`upsertLeadQuality` idempotent per campaign+week,
`listLeadQuality`, `leadQualityResponseRate`), routes under `/api/admin/*`.
Verified: 2 DB integration tests (billing + conversion; lead-quality upsert +
response rate).

### 2026-08-03 — Ops console: first-campaign review — AIC-18
Added the review workflow (`campaign_reviews` table): `submitReview` records
outcome + reviewer + timestamp + §11 checklist and moves status (approved →
active, unsupported → unmanaged, changes_requested → stays under_review). The §11
hard rule is enforced — a changes_requested campaign is not activated until
`recordCustomerDecision(true)` records explicit customer approval. Routes under
`/api/admin/campaigns/:id/review` + `/reviews/:id/customer-decision`. Verified: 4
DB integration tests (all outcomes + no-activation-without-approval).

### 2026-08-03 — Ops console: needs-attention queue — AIC-17
Added `OpsQueue` over `ops_queue_item`: one prioritized worklist across all
accounts (high severity first, then oldest; resolved fall away), a canonical
`create` (high-sev logged for the alert hook), and triage (`claim` → in_progress +
claimed_by; `resolve(note)`). Routes under `GET/POST /api/admin/ops-queue`.
Verified: DB integration (severity sort, claim, resolve).

### 2026-08-03 — Ops console: customers view — AIC-16
Added `listCustomers` / `getCustomerDetail` assembling each account's info +
subscription + connection health + campaign + agreed budget + outstanding
recommendation + open ops-item count from the real tables, at
`GET /api/admin/customers[/:id]`. Migration 010 adds ops-queue triage columns +
the `campaign_reviews` table for the rest of P0.4. Verified: DB + HTTP integration.

### 2026-08-03 — Action history surface — AIC-15
Added the per-campaign audit surface reading only from `action_history`:
`listCampaignActionHistory` / `listCustomerActionHistory` (newest-first, full PRD
§23 fields, automated-vs-human), and `condense()` — a jargon-free plain-Hebrew
projection for customer reuse. Exposed at `GET /api/admin/campaigns/:id/history`
(`?condensed=true`). Verified: DB + HTTP integration test. Completes P0.3.

### 2026-08-03 — Emergency controls + failure handling — AIC-14
Added per-account kill-switches (disable/enable automation, freeze/unfreeze
execution, mark unmanaged, pause management) as immediate DB flags (migration 009
adds `execution_frozen`), exposed at `POST /api/admin/campaigns/:id/controls`.
`ControlService.assertExecutable` is the control gate the SafeExecutor already
calls — flipping any switch halts execution on the next attempt (rec stays
approved). Failure handling (ops item + plain-Hebrew customer message + failed
action_history, never a silent success) is enforced in the AIC-12 pipeline.
Verified: 6 tests (gate per flag; kill-switch halts a batch mid-way). Telegram
alerting + ops-console surfacing land with P0.4.

### 2026-08-03 — Safe-execute pipeline — AIC-12
Added `SafeExecutor.execute`: the ordered pipeline for executing an approved
recommendation — relevance → access-health hold → emergency-control hold → claim
executing → external-change detection (cancel, never overwrite) → budget-safety
block → execute → read-back verify (mismatch = failure) → log to action_history.
Access-lost and automation-stop are holds (rec stays approved); external-change,
over-budget, write-fail, and verify-mismatch are failures with an ops item + a
plain-Hebrew customer message. A failed execution never looks succeeded.
replace_creative escalates to ops as a human task. Verified: 10 scenario tests.

### 2026-08-03 — Budget safety + idempotent write outbox — AIC-13
Added `assertWithinBudget` (agreed budget is a hard ceiling; ≤0 or over-ceiling
rejected; null/non-budget passes) and `meta_write_outbox` (migration 008): a
durable queue with a unique idempotency key per intended change (repeat enqueue =
no-op), `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` draining, backoff/retry to MAX_ATTEMPTS, and
terminal succeeded rows. Only absolute-set idempotent ops (set_daily_budget,
pause_ad) are enqueued, so a lost-response retry re-applies to the same end state.
Verified: 4 budget unit tests + 3 DB integration tests (enqueue idempotency,
exactly-once drain, backoff-then-succeed).

### 2026-08-03 — LLM explainer (plain-Hebrew, never decides) — AIC-10
Added the explainer: `explain(rec)` renders each recommendation type + a weekly
status as plain business Hebrew from a centralized copy table, injecting figures
from the structured record by code (deterministic fallback, always works).
`explainWithLlm` optionally rephrases but accepts the model's text only if every
figure survives verbatim and no Ads Manager jargon appears — the "LLM explains,
never decides" boundary, enforced structurally. Documented in `docs/RULES.md`.
Verified: 10 tests (number-fidelity, jargon-absence, fallback, rejection of a
number-changing or jargon-introducing rephrase). P0.2 recommendation engine
complete.

### 2026-08-03 — Recommendation staleness + expiry — AIC-11
Added `refreshRecommendations` as the canonical eval tick: a proposed rec is valid
iff the same gated rules still produce an equivalent rec from current evidence;
otherwise it's expired (and replaced when a different action is now warranted). An
expired rec is un-approvable by construction (AIC-8 state machine). "Material
divergence" is defined as rules-no-longer-yield-it. Verified: 4 tests
(evidence-holds → stays; diverged → expires; expired → un-approvable; replaced).

### 2026-08-03 — Deterministic recommendation rules v1 — AIC-9
Added the rules engine: `evaluateCampaign` runs five rule types
(pause_weak_creative, replace_creative, decrease_budget, increase_budget,
no_action) over per-campaign evidence, gated by named minimum-evidence thresholds
(`RULE_THRESHOLDS`) — below the gate it emits `no_action`, never a forced change.
Zero LLM involvement; output fully structured. `rule-evaluator.ts` assembles
evidence from `insight_snapshot`, persists an acting draft as `proposed` (deduped;
`no_action` not stored). Thresholds + priority documented in `docs/RULES.md`.
Verified: 14 rule fixture tests (fires when it should, does NOT on thin evidence) +
3 evaluator tests.

### 2026-08-03 — Recommendation state machine — AIC-8
Added the recommendation lifecycle as an explicit state machine
(`proposed→approved→executing→executed|failed`, plus `dismissed`/`expired`),
illegal transitions rejected before any write. `RecommendationService` wraps every
transition with the state-machine check + an optimistic store guard
(`StaleRecommendationError` on a lost race); `completeExecution` writes the PRD §23
audit row to `action_history`. `no_action` is a first-class type. pg + in-memory
stores. Verified: 9 unit + 1 DB integration test.

### 2026-08-03 — Dogfood readout (admin) — AIC-7
Added the internal readout: `buildCampaignReadout` (status + current/previous
7-day totals + per-creative rows + period deltas, read only from
`insight_snapshot`), the `/api/admin` routes behind a `requireAdmin` guard, and
the `/admin/readout` React screen (Hebrew, RTL; `formatShekel`, NULL CPL → "—").
Verified: deltaPct unit test + DB/HTTP integration test, and rendered end-to-end
against seeded Pisga snapshots on a local Postgres (status active, ₪734 spend
+8%, 18 leads +20%, CPL ₪40.78 −10%, 3-creative table). Reconciliation vs Ads
Manager gated on real ingestion.

### 2026-08-03 — Insights ingestion → insight_snapshot — AIC-6
Added the ingestion pipeline: `getInsights` on the Meta client (4 grains, creative
derived from ad rows), pure metric functions (`extractLeads` — 7d-preferred, never
double-counted; `computeCpl` — NULL at 0 leads; `normalizeRow` — spend→agorot), the
snapshot store (idempotent upsert per (campaign, grain, object, period) + period
totals), and `runIngestionTick` (per-campaign isolation: a Meta error is caught,
logged, retried next tick, never crashes the run). Wired an inert-until-token
scheduler into `index.ts`. Lead/CPL documented in `docs/METRICS.md`. Verified: 12
new unit tests + 2 DB integration tests (idempotency, period totals). Live against
Pisga gated on a real System User token + linked campaign.

### 2026-08-03 — Meta connection + access-loss detection — AIC-5
Added the Meta client abstraction (`GraphMetaClient` + `FakeMetaClient`), a Graph
error → access-health classifier, the connection store (pg + in-memory), and
`ConnectionService`: verify folds per-asset access into one health, persists
transitions, and raises a single `meta_connection_failure` ops item on loss.
`assertExecutable` throws `AccessHaltedError` unless health is `ok` — the P0.3
execution-halt safety rule. Customer-facing reconnect copy added to `strings.ts`
(plain Hebrew, no Meta jargon; `connectionMessage()` maps every non-ok state to
one prompt). Verified: 8 service + 3 classifier unit tests, and a DB integration
test proving persistence + ops item + halt end-to-end. Live-against-Pisga is
gated on a real System User token (AIC-3 operator steps) and AIC-1.

### 2026-08-03 — Meta setup runbook — AIC-3
Added `docs/META_SETUP.md`: the one-time Meta-side configuration (Business
Portfolio, app, System User + token scopes, partner-asset assignment, token
storage/rotation posture) in the accurate access framing (partner access +
System User, subject to Meta's required Marketing API tier; no customer OAuth in
P0). Added `META_*` env placeholders to `server/.env.example`. The operator steps
(mint token, assign Pisga's ad account) are executed in Meta's UI by a person and
are checklisted in the doc; the app only consumes the resulting token + asset IDs.

### 2026-08-03 — Core data model: 10 P0 entities — AIC-4
Added migrations `002`–`007` creating the ten P0 tables (customers,
subscriptions, meta_connections, ad_accounts, managed_campaigns,
insight_snapshots, recommendations, action_history, lead_quality_feedback,
ops_queue_items) with FKs, indexes, and CHECK-enum columns mirrored in
`shared/src/domain.ts`. Money is integer agorot; `action_history` is append-only;
the snapshot idempotency key is `(campaign, grain, object, period)`. Added the
Pisga dogfood seed (idempotent) and a DB integration test (self-skips without
`DATABASE_URL`). RLS deliberately not adopted (Neon has no PostgREST surface;
rationale in DATA_MODEL.md). Verified against a local Postgres: 7 migrations
apply, seed idempotent, 4/4 integration tests green.

### 2026-08-03 — Stack scaffold (server / web / shared) — AIC-2
Scaffolded the monorepo from Pisga's proven stack: npm workspaces
(`shared` / `server` / `web`), TypeScript throughout, Neon Postgres via a
numbered-migration runner (`001_init.sql` creates the `_migrations` ledger only;
the P0 entities land in AIC-4), an Express API with a root `/health` for Railway
and an `/api` mount point, a Vite + React SPA with the static landing served at
root, the `strings.ts` copy file, `railway.json`, and a GitHub `ci` workflow
(typecheck + build + unit tests). `shared/money.ts` enforces integer-agorot money.
Verified locally: typecheck, build, and 5/5 unit tests green. No DB/e2e in CI yet
(waiting on a Neon dev-branch `DATABASE_URL`).

### 2026-08-02 — Repo bootstrap: governance layer
Created the standalone AI Campaigner repo with its operating rules
([CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)), the `feature-docs` skill, and the docs system
(INDEX routing table + this changelog + the feature-doc template). Establishes the
docs-travel-with-code and ship discipline before any feature work, so every later
change inherits it. Stack scaffold (server/web/CI/Railway/Neon) lands separately.
