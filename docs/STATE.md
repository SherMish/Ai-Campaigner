# docs/STATE.md — dated changelog

Newest first. One `### YYYY-MM-DD — <title>` block per change: **what changed and
why**. Append a block; never edit an existing line. Behaviour is specified in the
owning doc under [features/](features/), not here.

## Changelog

### 2026-08-02 — Repo bootstrap: governance layer
Created the standalone AI Campaigner repo with its operating rules
([CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)), the `feature-docs` skill, and the docs system
(INDEX routing table + this changelog + the feature-doc template). Establishes the
docs-travel-with-code and ship discipline before any feature work, so every later
change inherits it. Stack scaffold (server/web/CI/Railway/Neon) lands separately.
