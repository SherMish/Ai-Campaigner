# Ops console (internal)

**Status:** in progress — the operator surfaces. AIC-16 (customers view) done;
needs-attention queue (AIC-17), first-campaign review (AIC-18), and billing +
lead-quality (AIC-19) extend this doc.

**Source of truth:** services under `server/src/services/` + routes in
`server/src/routes/admin.ts` (all behind `requireAdmin`).

---

## Customers view (AIC-16)

`listCustomers(pool)` returns the operator's list with status-at-a-glance
(subscription status, connection health, campaign status, agreed budget, open-rec
count) assembled from the real tables. `getCustomerDetail(pool, id)` adds the full
business info, contact, next-charge date, the outstanding proposed recommendation,
and open ops-item count. Routes: `GET /api/admin/customers`,
`GET /api/admin/customers/:id`. Reads only; role-gated. Source:
`server/src/services/customers.js`. Tests: `customers.integration.test.ts`.

## Needs-attention queue (AIC-17)

`OpsQueue` is the single prioritized worklist over `ops_queue_item` across all
accounts — high severity first, then oldest; resolved items fall away.
`create` is the canonical entry point (support intake, delivery checks; the
connection-health and execution paths already raise items), logging high-severity
ones for the alert hook (Telegram later). Operators triage: `claim` → in_progress
+ claimed_by; `resolve(note)` → resolved + note. Routes: `GET /api/admin/ops-queue`
(`?all=true` includes resolved), `POST /ops-queue`, `POST /ops-queue/:id/claim`,
`POST /ops-queue/:id/resolve`. Source: `server/src/services/ops-queue.js`. Tests:
`ops-queue.integration.test.ts`.
